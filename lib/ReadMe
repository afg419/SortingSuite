SortingSuite -- First Project for the Turing School

lib:
  bubble_sort: Implements bubble sort algorithm
  insertion_sort: Implements insertion sort algorithm
  merge_sort: Implements merge sort algorithm
  selection_sort: Implements selection sort algorithm
  merge2_sort: Implements merge sort, but without the use of recursion
  matrix_sort: Uses merge sort an array of arrays
  benchmarks: Provides methods for timing the algorithms
  swap_methods: Provides methods required by multiple sort algorithms

test:
  Tests for each sort algorithm including for randomly created arrays.
